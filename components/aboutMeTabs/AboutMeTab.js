        I am a continual learner who has built up some experience working as a JavaScript and Web Application developer.
        I am constantly looking to improve myself and better understand the work experience. I work hard for the chance
        to prove myself in many different working environments and I am always willing to learn new languages or tools
        to further myself and become a more valuable asset. <br />
        <br /> I have been working almost every day since the age of 15 and continue to work on myself. I enjoy learning
        new things and I have an educated background. I graduated college from Concordia University of Austin in
        December of 2017 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I have been working on my skills and have put
        together a few websites that demonstrate what I have learned. I am constantly working on new things in my spare
        time, to better understand and have fun with the work that I like to do. <br />
        <br />
        Outside of work, I have a few different interests. I like to: play videogames, play card or board games, watch
        Netflix/Hulu, watch anime, and learn new things. I am easy-going and have a great sense of humor. I am very
        reliable and responsible, you can rest easy and count on me! If you would like to contact me regarding a job
        opportunity or anything at all, my contact information is on the{' '}
